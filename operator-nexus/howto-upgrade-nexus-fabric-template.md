# Fabric runtime upgrade template

This how-to guide is a step-by-step template on how to upgrade a Nexus Fabric. The template is designed to assist users in managing a reproducible end-to-end upgrade through Azure APIs and standard operating procedures. Regular updates are crucial to maintain system integrity and to access the latest product improvements.

## Overview
<details>
<summary> Overview of the Fabric runtime upgrade template. </summary>

### Runtime bundle components

These components require operator consent for upgrades that might affect traffic behavior or necessitate device reboots. The network fabric's design allows updates to be applied while maintaining continuous data traffic flow.

This is how runtime changes are categorized:

- **Operating system updates**: Necessary to support new features or resolve issues.
- **Base configuration updates**: Initial settings applied during device bootstrapping.
- **Configuration structure updates**: Generated based on user input for conf.

</details>

## Prerequisites

</details>

## Debug information for Azure CLI commands
<details>
<summary> Collect debug information for Azure CLI commands. </summary>

Azure CLI deployment commands issued with the `--debug` value contain the following information in the command output:

```
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'mise-correlation-id': '<MISE_CID>'
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'x-ms-correlation-request-id': '<CORRELATION_ID>'
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'Azure-AsyncOperation': '<ASYNC_URL>'
```

To view the status of long-running asynchronous operations, run the following command with `az rest`:

```
az rest -m get -u '<ASYNC_URL>'
```

Command status information is returned along with detailed informational or error messages:

- `"status": "Accepted"`
- `"status": "Succeeded"`
- `"status": "Failed"`

If you experience any failures, open a support request. Report the values for `<MISE_CID>` and `<CORRELATION_ID>`, and the status code and detailed messages.

</details>

## Prechecks
<details>
<summary> Perform the following prechecks before you start a Fabric upgrade. </summary>

1. Validate the provisioning status for the Network Fabric Controller (NFC), Fabric, and Fabric Devices.

   Log in to the Azure CLI and select or set the `<CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>` value:

   ```
   az login
   az account set --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
   ```

   Make sure that the NFC is in a provisioned state:

   ```
   az networkfabric controller show -g <NFC_RG> --resource-name <NFC_NAME> --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID> -o table
   ```

   Check the NF status:

   ```
   az networkfabric fabric show -g <NF_RG> --resource-name <NF_NAME> --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID> -o table
   ```

   Record the values for `fabricVersion` and `provisioningState`.

   Check the status of the devices.

   ```
   az networkfabric device list -g <NF_RG> -o table --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
   ```

   >[!Note]
   > If the `provisioningState` isn't reported as `Succeeded`, stop the upgrade until the issues are resolved.

2. The minimum available disk space on each device must be more than 3.5 GB for a successful device upgrade.

   Verify the available space on each Fabric Device by using the following Azure CLI command.

   ```
   az networkfabric device run-ro --resource-name <NF_DEVICE_NAME> --resource-group <NF_RG> --ro-command "show file systems" --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID> --debug
   ```

   Contact Microsoft support if there isn't enough space to perform the upgrade. Archived Extensible Operating System (EOS) images and support bundle files can be removed at the direction of support.

3. Check the Fabric's Network Packet Broker (NPB) for any orphaned `Network Taps` in the Azure portal.

   * Select **Network Fabrics** under **Azure Services** and then select <NF_NAME>.
   * Select the appropriate resource group for the Fabric.
   * In the **Resources** list, use the **Network Packet Broker** filter.
   * Select the appropriate **Network Packet Broker** name in the list.
   * Select the **Network Taps** tab on the **Overview** screen.
   * All `Network Taps` should have a status of **Succeeded** for **Configuration State** and **Provisioning State**.
   * Look for any Taps with a red X, and a status of **Not Found**, **Failed**, or **Error**.

   >[!Note]
   > If any Taps show a status of **Not Found**, **Failed**, or **Error**, stop the upgrade until issues are cleared. Provide this information to Microsoft Support when you open a support ticket for Tap issues.

4. Run and validate the Fabric cable validation report.
   Follow [Validate Cables for Nexus Network Fabric](how-to-validate-cables.md) to set up and run.

   >[!Note]
   > Resolve any connection and cable issues before you continue the upgrade.

5. Review Operator Nexus release notes for the required checks and configuration updates that aren't included in this document.

## Upgrade Procedure

<details>
<summary> Fabric runtime upgrade procedure details </summary>

### Verify the current Fabric runtime version

[Check the current cluster runtime version.](./howto-check-runtime-version.md#check-current-fabric-runtime-version)

```
az networkfabric fabric list -g <NF_RG> --query "[].{name:name,fabricVersion:fabricVersion,configurationState:configurationState,provisioningState:provisioningState}" -o table --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
az networkfabric fabric show -g <NF_RG> --resource-name <NF_NAME> --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
```

### Initiate the Fabric upgrade

Start the upgrade by using the following command:

```Azure CLI
az networkfabric fabric upgrade -g <NF_RG> --resource-name <NF_NAME> --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID> --action start --version "6.0.0"
{}
```

> [!Note]
> The upgrade was successful if you get an output showing `{}`.

The Fabric Resource Provider validates whether your existing Fabric version can be upgraded to the target version. Only N+1 major release upgrades are allowed (for example, 5.0.0 to 6.0.0).

On successful completion, the command changes the Fabric status to **Under Maintenance** and prevents any other operation on the Fabric instance.

### Follow the device-specific workflow

Nexus Network Fabric Racks are composed of the following device types:

- Customer Edge (CE) Switches
- Management (MGMT) Switches
- Top Of Rack (TOR) Switches
- Network Packet Brokers (NPB)

Eight Rack environments have 30 Devices:

- **Aggregate Rack**: Two CEs, two NPB, and two MGMT Switches (six devices total).
- **Eight Compute Racks**: Each compute rack has two TORs and one MGMT Switch (24 devices total).

Four Rack environments have 17 Devices:

- Aggregate Rack: Two CEs, one NPB, and two MGMT Switches (five devices total).
- Four Compute Racks: Each Compute Rack has two TORs and one MGMT Switch (12 devices total).

The devices must be upgraded in the following specific order to maintain networking service during the upgrade.

1. Compute Rack odd numbered TOR upgrade together in parallel.
1. Compute Rack even numbered TOR upgrade together in parallel.
1. Compute Rack MGMT switches upgrade together in parallel.
1. Aggregate Rack CEs upgrade one after the other in serial.

   >[!Important]
   >After each CE upgrade, wait for a duration of five minutes to ensure that the recovery process is complete before proceeding to the next CE.
   
   >[!Important]
   >For the remaining Aggregate Rack devices, the order for the device upgrades is not important as long as they are done in a serial manner.

1. Aggregate Rack NPBs upgrade one after the other in serial.
1. Aggregate Rack MGMT switches upgrade one after the other in serial.

>[!NOTE]
> Wait for a successful upgrade to complete on all the devices in a group before moving to the next group.

### Follow device-specific upgrade

Run the following command to upgrade the version on each device:

```
az networkfabric device upgrade --version <NF_VERSION> -g <NF_RG> --resource-name <NF_DEVICE_NAME> --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID> --debug
```

As part of the upgrade, the devices are put into maintenance mode. The device drains all traffic and stops advertising routes so that the traffic flow to the device stops. At completion, the Nexus Network Fabric (NNF) service updates the device resource version property to the new version.

Gather the **ASYNC URL** and **Correlation ID** info for further troubleshooting if needed.

```
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'mise-correlation-id': '<MISE_CID>'
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'x-ms-correlation-request-id': '<CORRELATION_ID>'
cli.azure.cli.core.sdk.policies:     'Azure-AsyncOperation': '<ASYNC_URL>'
```

Provide this information to Microsoft Support when opening a support ticket for upgrade issues.

After you finish upgrading devices, make sure that they all show the `<NF_VERSION>` by running the following command:

```
az networkfabric device list -g <NF_RG> --query "[].{name:name,version:version}" -o table --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
```

### Complete the Network Fabric upgrade

After all the devices are upgraded, run the following command to take the Network Fabric out of the maintenance state.

```
az networkfabric fabric upgrade --action Complete --version <NF_VERSION> -g <NF_RG> --resource-name <NF_NAME> --debug --subscription <CUSTOMER_SUB_ID>
```

### Troubleshoot device update failures

1. Collect any errors in the Azure CLI output.
2. Collect the device operation state from the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
3. Create an Azure Support Request for any device upgrade failures and attach any errors along with the **ASYNC URL**, **correlation ID**, and the operation state of the Fabric instance and the devices.
