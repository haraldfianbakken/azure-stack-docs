# About Azure private endpoints on Azure Local

This article provides an overview of Azure private endpoints on Azure Local and the supported scenarios. 

## About private endpoints for Azure Local

A private endpoint for Azure Local is a network interface that uses a private IP address from the virtual network associated with your Azure Local. Private endpoints enable Azure services to be accessed over a private network connection rather than the public internet

## Supported private endpoint scenarios

Azure Local infrastructure (including the nodes and the Arc resource bridge VM) supports many [Azure private endpoint types](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview), but Azure Arc Private Link is not supported. Because of this, Azure Local always registers with Azure Arc using public Arc endpoints. 

For more information, see [Use Azure Private Link to Connect Servers to Azure Arc by Using a private endpoint](/azure/azure-arc/servers/private-link-security) and [Troubleshoot Azure Arc resource bridge issues]().

The following table summarizes key points for using supported private endpoints with Azure Local.

| Scenario | Private endpoint outbound path | Supported private endpoint types | Key requirements or limitations |
|----|----|:--:|:--:|----|
| **1. No proxy, no Arc gateway** | Direct. <br> Routed via Express Route or S2S VPN | Storage, SQL, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry and other PaaS services supporting Private Link | Configure routing and DNS for private endpoints; no proxy bypass needed |
| **2. With proxy, no Arc gateway** | Proxy bypassed. <br> Routed via Express Route or S2S VPN | Storage, SQL, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry and other PaaS services supporting Private Link | Configure routing, DNS and proxy bypass list for private endpoint FQDNs |
| **3. No proxy, with Arc gateway** | AKS cluster IP proxy bypassed. <br> Routed via Express Route or S2S VPN | Storage, SQL, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry and other PaaS services supporting Private Link | Configure routing, DNS and environment variables for AKS/Arc resource bridge after Arc registration to bypass private endpoint FQDNs |
| **4. With proxy, with Arc gateway** | Proxy bypassed. <br> Routed via Express Route or S2S VPN | Storage, SQL, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry and other PaaS services supporting Private Link | Configure routing, DNS and proxy bypass for private endpoint FQDNs |

### DNS requirements

Azure Local infrastructure must always resolve Azure Arc endpoints to public IP addresses. Azure Arc Private Link is not supported for Azure Local nodes or the Arc resource bridge VM.

- If your organization uses Azure Arc Private Link elsewhere, Azure Local must use separate DNS servers that do not resolve Arc endpoints to private IPs.

    - **Required public DNS resolution**: The following Azure Arc endpoints must resolve to public IP addresses on Azure Local nodes and any enterprise proxy:

        - `gbl.his.arc.azure.com`
        - `agentserviceapi.guestconfiguration.azure.com`

    - **Resolution to private IP ranges**: Private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x) aren't supported.

- **DNS for Azure PaaS services** - Private endpoints for services such as Key Vaults, Storage Accounts, SQL, Azure Container Registry, or other PaaS offerings alongside Azure Local are supported.
    - DNS infrastructure must resolve the PaaS service FQDN to an internal IP address.
    - Network routing must correctly direct traffic as per the destination:
        -  To the public internet for public endpoints.
        -  Through Azure ExpressRoute/Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN for private endpoints.

### Support for Azure Local VMs and Arc Private Link

Although Azure Local nodes and Arc Resource Bridge VM don't support Arc private link, you can use Arc Private Link inside Azure Local VMs if the DNS servers in use aren't the same as those used for the Azure Local infrastructure (Azure Local infrastructure DNS servers must not resolve Arc private endpoints).

- To enable Arc Private Link on existing Azure Local VMs, follow [Use Azure Private Link to Connect Servers to Azure Arc by Using a private endpoint](/azure/azure-arc/servers/private-link-security#configure-an-existing-azure-arc-enabled-server).
- For new Azure Local VMs, you can't enable Arc Private Link during deployment yet.

### Arc resource bridge and AKS reserved network subnets with private endpoints

When deploying Arc Resource Bridge VM in Azure Local:

- Keep in mind that the following IP ranges are reserved for Kubernetes pods and services.


    | **Service** | **Designated IP range** |
    |----|----|
    | Arc resource bridge Kubernetes pods | 10.244.0.0/16 (from 10.244.0.1 to 10.244.255.254) |
    | Arc resource bridge Kubernetes services | 10.96.0.0/12 (from 10.96.0.1 to 10.111.255.54) |

- Ensure that your PaaS services private endpoint IPs on the Azure VNET subnet used by AKS workloads don't overlap with any of reserved Kubernetes subnets.

    For example, if your private endpoint has an IP from an Azure subnet 10.244.1.0/24, AKS understands such IP as reserved and the request doesn't leave the AKS virtual networks and never reaches the private endpoint in the Azure VNET. However, if the private endpoint IP is on an Azure subnet 10.245.0.0/24, AKS resolves the endpoint as external and routes the traffic to reach the private endpoint.

## Unsupported scenarios

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Local doesn't support Azure Arc Private Link for all the tabulated scenarios, and Azure Local infrastructure (nodes and Arc resource bridge VM) must use public Arc endpoints.
