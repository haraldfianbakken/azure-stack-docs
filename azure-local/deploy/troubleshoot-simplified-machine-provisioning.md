# Troubleshoot simplified machine provisioning for hyperconverged deployments of Azure Local (preview)

[!INCLUDE [hci-preview](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

This article describes how to troubleshoot simplified machine provisioning. You can use the following methods to troubleshoot:

- Run diagnostic tests.
- Collect a support package.
- Collect logs from your Azure Subscription.

## Run diagnostic tests from the Configurator app

To diagnose and troubleshoot any device issues related to hardware, time server, and network, you can run the diagnostics tests. Follow these steps to run the diagnostic tests from the app:

1. Select the help icon in the top-right corner of the app to open **Support + troubleshooting**.

1. Select **Run diagnostic tests**. The diagnostic tests check the health of the server hardware, time server, and the network connectivity. The tests also check the status of the Azure Arc agent and the extensions.

1. After the tests are completed, the results are displayed. Resolve the issues and retry the operation.

## Collect a support package from the app

A log package is composed of all the relevant logs that can help Microsoft Support troubleshoot any device issues. You can generate a log package via the local web UI. Follow these steps to collect a support package from the app:

1. Select the help icon in the top-right corner of the app to open **Support + troubleshooting**.

1. Select **Create** to begin support package collection. The package collection could take several minutes.

1. After the support package is created, select **Download**. A zipped package is downloaded on your local system. You can unzip the package and view the system log files.

## Collect logs from your Azure subscription

If you can't access the machine using the Configurator app, you can get the app logs from the server. Access the logs by connecting with PowerShell.

The logs are stored in the following locations:

| Target operating system | Log files |
|--|--|
| Azure Stack HCI | `C:\Windows\System32\Bootstrap\Logs` |
| Maintenance environment | `/var/log/bootstrap`<br>`/var/log/provisioningextension`<br>`/var/log/trident-full.log`<br>`/var/log/messages`<br>`/var/log/bootstraprestservice` |

## Maintenance environment known issues

**Problem:** The USB Boot enters an infinite USB boot sequence if the BIOS Settings `Boot USB Devices First` is set on the machine.

**Cause:**

When the BIOS setting `Boot USB Devices First` is enabled on the machine, the system enters an infinite USB boot cycle. This setting overrides the configured boot order and always prioritizes booting from any connected USB device. As a result, even after the maintenance environment is successfully installed, subsequent reboots continue to boot from the USB media instead of the internal disk.

This behavior causes a continuous boot loop in which the device repeatedly:

1. Boots from the USB device.
1. Reinstalls the maintenance environment.
1. Reboots.

From the customer’s perspective, the device appears to be in an infinite cycle of installation and reboot, which occurs approximately every 10 minutes.

**Recommendation:**

Disable the `Boot USB Devices First` BIOS option (or the equivalent setting, depending on the hardware model and BIOS version).

TODO1: Engineering: The BIOS screenshot provided in the engineering TSG is for SFF devices; can we please get one for supported Azure Local hardware? dsarkar is working on this.

## Operating system image drop down is empty

**Problem:** In Azure portal, select **Azure Arc** > **Operations** > **Machine provisioning (preview)** > **Get started** > **Provision**. In the **Provision new machines** page, the **Operating system** > **Image** drop down is empty.

:::image type="content" source="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-initial-creation-failure-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot 1 showing an empty Image Url drop down." border="false" lightbox="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-initial-creation-failure-1.png":::

**Cause:** The resource provider registration for `Microsoft.AzureStackHCI` is missing.

**Recommendation:** Register the resource provider as described in the [prerequisites](simplified-machine-provisioning#azure-prerequisites).

## When you provision new machines, ARM template validation fails

**Problem:** In Azure portal, select **Azure Arc** > **Operations** > **Machine provisioning (preview)** > **Get started** > **Provision**. In the **Provision new machines** page, when you select **Create**, you see the error messages `Arm template validation failed` and `Deployment template validation failed: 'The value for the template parameter 'hciRPServiceprincipalID' at line '1' and column '10174' is not provided. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-create-parameter-file for usage details.'. (Code: InvalidTemplate)`

:::image type="content" source="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-initial-creation-failure-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a failed ARM template validation." border="false" lightbox="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-initial-creation-failure-3.png":::

**Cause:** This issue can happen if you're using Azure Stack HCI for the first time in this subscription.

**Recommendation:** Wait 15 minutes and retry.

## When you provision new machines, you receive an internal server error

**Problem:** In Azure portal, select **Azure Arc** > **Operations** > **Machine provisioning (preview)** > **Get started** > **Provision**. In the **Provision new machines** page, when you select **Create**, you see the error messages `The resource write operation failed to complete successfully, because it reached terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.` and `Failed to verify creation of MoboBroker resource. (Code: InternalServerError)`

TODO1: anbacker: I reworded these but please feel free to reword further.

**Causes:** This can have one of the following causes:

1. You have a resource group policy that requires resource groups to be created in a specific region. In this preview release, only the `eastus` region supports simplified machine provisioning.

1. You have a resource group policy that automatically adds tags to newly created resource groups. Simplified machine provisioning doesn't currently support this.

1. You have a resource group policy that enforces naming conventions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Remove the resource group policy that requires resource groups to be created in a specific region.

1. Remove the resource group policy that automatically adds tags to newly created resource groups.

1. When you create a new site, you can select **Configure** to provide a custom resource group name.

## Provisioned machine creation fails with the error message "StorageAccountForbidden"

TODO1: Engineering: Can you please provide more details on the potential issues with storage account creation policies? anbacker is working on this.

**Cause:** Your storage account creation policy doesn't support simplified machine provisioning, or you didn't register the `Microsoft.Storage` resource provider.

**Recommendation:**

1. Register the resource provider as described in the [prerequisites](simplified-machine-provisioning#azure-prerequisites).

1. Delete the provisioned machine and create it again.

## Provisioned machine creation fails with the error message "DeviceOnboardingConflict"

**Cause:** You didn't register the `MachineProvision` feature or the `Microsoft.OnboardingService` resource provider.

**Recommendation:**

1. Register the `MachineProvision` feature and required resource providers as described in the [prerequisites](simplified-machine-provisioning#azure-prerequisites).

1. Delete the provisioned machine and create it again.

## Provisioned machine creation fails with the error message "UpdateArcSettingDataFailed"

**Cause:** You didn't register the `Microsoft.HybridCompute` resource provider.

**Recommendation:**

1. Register the resource provider as described in the [prerequisites](simplified-machine-provisioning#azure-prerequisites).

1. Delete the provisioned machine and create it again.

## Reattempt a failed OS provisioning

TODO1: Engineering: This came from the engineering TSG. It involves URL hacking and might be too complex for customers; let me know if I should remove it.

**Problem:** Simplified machine provisioning currently doesn't support automatic retries from the service in case the OS installation fails.

**Recommendation:**

To retry OS provisioning:

1. In Azure portal, select **Azure Arc** > **Operations** > **Machine provisioning (preview)**.

1. Select **Provisioned machines**.

1. Select the provisioned machine you want to investigate.

1. In the **Overview** page, add `/jobs/ProvisionOs` to the URL.

1. Open **JSON View** and record the Json.

    :::image type="content" source="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-reattempt-failed-os-provisioning.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reattempt a failed OS provisioning." border="false" lightbox="media/simplified-machine-provisioning/troubleshooting-reattempt-failed-os-provisioning.png":::

1. Send a `PUT` request to the modified URL, as follows:

    TODO1: Engineering: Is this meant to be done with cURL or some similar tool?

    Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values.

    `PUT /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/edgeMachines/<PROVISIONED_MACHINE_NAME>/jobs/ProvisionOs?api-version=2025-12-01-preview`

    In the request body, copy only the `osProfile` and `userDetails` objects from the Json you recorded previously.

    ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        "provisioningRequest": {
          "osProfile": {
            "osType": "HCI",
            "vsrVersion": "12.2601.1002.503",
            "osImageLocation": "https://aka.ms/aep/hci/2601",
            "operationType": "Provision"
          },
          "userDetails": [
            {
              "userName": "admin",
              "secretType": "KeyVault",
              "secretLocation": "https://chinmaya-test-site-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/chinmaya-site-hci-91771406594695"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Clean up resources

You can attempt to delete the provisioned machine resource at any time. Deleting the resource also deletes related objects, such as resources under the managed resource group.

TODO1: Engineering: Can you please review this section? Is this useful to customers? If not, I'll remove it.

In the resource group where you run simplified machine provisioning, there are two hidden resources: a configuration resource, and a resource called the `MOBO broker`. You can't delete the `MOBO broker` resource directly. If you delete the resource group, the `MOBO broker` resource is deleted with it. Also, if you delete the configuration resource, the `MOBO broker` resource is deleted with it.

Be careful when deleting the configuration resource. Deleting the configuration resource brings down devices that haven't yet reached the `Ready to cluster` stage.
