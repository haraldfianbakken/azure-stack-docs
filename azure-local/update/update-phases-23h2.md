# Review update phases of Azure Local

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes the preparation and installation phases of the Azure Local update workflow, including how updates are downloaded, validated, health-checked, and installed. It also explains how update progress is reported at various stages.

For more detailed information on progress reporting, see [Use Azure Update Manager to update Azure Local](azure-update-manager-23h2.md) and [Update Azure Local via PowerShell](update-via-powershell-23h2.md).

## Overview

Azure Local updates follow a two-phase workflow:

1. **Preparation**: Download content, validate and extract packages, and run health checks to confirm the cluster is ready.
1. **Installation**: Apply the update across the cluster via an orchestrated action plan.

Each stage produces an `UpdateRun` resource that records step-by-step progress, timing, and any errors encountered. You can query the details of this run on the **Update Progress** page in Azure Update Manager or by using the `Get-SolutionUpdateRun` cmdlet in PowerShell.

## Preparation workflow

1. Trigger preparation (optional)

    Start the preparation phase independently by running `Start-SolutionUpdate -PrepareOnly`. This step downloads and validates update content and runs health checks without starting installation. Use it to pre‑stage updates or validate cluster readiness before a maintenance window.

1. Meet prerequisites

    Before preparation, the update might be in an `AdditionalContentRequired` state. This state indicates the update package requires partner content. This applies to SBE updates and combined Solution plus SBE updates. The installed SBE package from the partner doesn't support automatic download of that content.

    If the update is in the `AdditionalContentRequired` state, you must import the content before you can begin preparation or installation. For more information, see [Update via PowerShell](update-via-powershell-23h2.md).

1. Run preparation phases

    The preparation workflow moves through the following phases in order.

### Download

The download phase retrieves the update package from the configured update source.

- **Standard download**: The Update Service downloads the main solution update package (NuGet bundles) directly from the update catalog.
- **Progress tracking**: The `ProgressPercentage` field on the `UpdateStateProperties` property on the Update reports download progress as a value from 0 to 100.

During this phase, the Update object transitions to the `Downloading` state. On failure, the state becomes `DownloadFailed`.

### SBE download connector (if applicable)

SBE updates and some Solution updates require extra content from the hardware vendor's Solution Builder Extension (SBE). When the SBE provides a download connector, the Update Service delegates part of the download to the OEM-supplied logic:

- The Update Service checks whether the installed SBE supports a download connector.
- If supported, an Orchestrator action plan invokes the SBE download action to retrieve OEM-specific packages such as firmware and drivers.
- The hardware vendor typically includes a download connectivity health check that must pass before the download starts.

If download fails while using the SBE download connector, the update state becomes `DownloadFailed`. To see the detailed failure message, examine the preparation details in Azure Update Manager in the portal, or using the `UpdateRun` object from `Get-SolutionUpdateRun`.

### Validate and extract

After all content is downloaded, the Update Service validates file integrity and extracts the update files.

If validation or extraction fails, the `UpdateRun` records the error and the Update state becomes `PreparationFailed`.

### Health check

Before installation, pre-update health checks run on the cluster. These checks validate that the cluster is in a healthy state. They also identify any issues that could interfere with a successful installation.

Each health check has an assigned severity:

| Severity | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Blocks the update. You must remediate these issues before installation can proceed. |
| **Warning** | Blocks the update by default. You can override these issues with `Start-SolutionUpdate -IgnoreWarnings`. |
| **Informational** | Advisory only. Doesn't block installation. |

If the update was started in **prepare-only** mode, the Update transitions to the `ReadyToInstall` state on health check success. If critical or warning failures are detected (when `-IgnoreWarnings` isn't specified), the status becomes `HealthCheckFailed`.

You can inspect health check results on the update object using:

```powershell
# View health check results
(Get-SolutionUpdate).HealthCheckResult |
Where-Object { ($_.Status -ne "Success") -and ($_.Severity -ne "Informational") } |
Format-List Title, Status, Severity, Description, Remediation
```

For help with troubleshooting health check failures, see [Troubleshoot updates](update-troubleshooting-23h2.md).

## Monitor preparation using Get-SolutionUpdateRun

Every call to `Start-SolutionUpdate` (with or without `-PrepareOnly`) creates an `UpdateRun` resource. You can retrieve the specific step details of preparation using:

```powershell
# Get the most recent update run for an update
Get-SolutionUpdate -Id <UpdateResourceId> | Get-SolutionUpdateRun | % Progress | % Steps
```

When a preparation run fails, the `UpdateRun` `State` property is set to `Failed` and the Progress step tree contains error details at the step that encountered the problem.

## Installation phase

After preparation completes, or when `Start-SolutionUpdate` is called without `-PrepareOnly`, the update enters the installation phase.

### Start installation

To start a full update that includes both preparation and installation, use:

```powershell
# Start a full update (preparation + installation)
Get-SolutionUpdate -Id <UpdateResourceId> | Start-SolutionUpdate
```

When the installation begins, the **Update state** transitions to **Installing** and a new `UpdateRun` is created that represents the progress of the installation, replacing the `UpdateRun` that previously represented preparation.

### `UpdateRun` installation progress

During installation, the `UpdateRun`'s `Progress` property contains the full action plan execution tree. This is a hierarchical structure of `Step` objects where each step represents a stage, role, or individual task in the update.

Each step in the progress tree exposes the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | string | Name of the step or task. |
| Description | string | Human-readable description. |
| Status | string | `InProgress`, `Success`, or `Error`. |
| StartTimeUtc | DateTime | When the step started executing. |
| EndTimeUtc | DateTime | When the step completed or failed. |
| ErrorMessage | string | Error details if the step failed. |
| ExpectedExecutionTime | TimeSpan | Estimated duration for progress calculation. |
| Steps | Step[] | Child steps forming the execution tree. |

### Monitor installation progress

Due to the complex structure of the `UpdateRun` object, monitor update installation status via the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/update-phases-23h2/update-run-structure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the UpdateRun structure." lightbox="media/update-phases-23h2/update-run-structure.png":::

If you need to monitor the update using PowerShell, directly monitor the state of the underlying action plan.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Start-MonitoringActionplanInstanceToComplete` cmdlet should only be used after the 2503 update is installed on the system. Before 2503, using this cmdlet to monitor update progress can introduce failures in the orchestration.

```powershell
# Get the action plan instance ID from the update run, then monitor
$run = Get-SolutionUpdate | where State -eq "Installing" | Get-SolutionUpdateRun | where State -eq "InProgress"
$id = ($run.ResourceId -split '/')[-1]
Start-MonitoringActionplanInstanceToComplete -actionPlanInstanceID $id
```

This provides real-time console output that refreshes automatically. Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the monitor without stopping the update.

### Installation state transitions

The Update moves through these states during installation:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Installing | Installation is actively running. |
| Installed | The update finished installing successfully. |
| InstallationFailed | One or more steps failed. |

### Diagnose and resume after installation failure

When installation fails, review the failure details in the Azure portal or via `Get-SolutionUpdateRun`. For troubleshooting guidance, see [Troubleshoot updates](update-troubleshooting-23h2.md).

After you review and mitigate the failure, or determine it's transient, resume the update from the Azure portal or using the `Start-SolutionUpdate` cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-SolutionUpdate | where State -eq "InstallationFailed" | Start-SolutionUpdate
```

After you run this cmdlet, the update state changes from `InstallationFailed` to `Installing`.
